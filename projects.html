        <h3>The Catch Keeper: Angler's Log</h3>
        <p>This is a personal project I’ve been developing called "The Catch Keeper: Angler's Log." It’s an app designed to help anglers log their fishing trips, including details like fish species, catch sizes, locations, and weather conditions. It also includes an interactive map for location tracking and data visualization features for fishing patterns over time. </p>
        <h4>Upcoming Features</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fish Species Database:</strong> A searchable database of common fish species with images, descriptions, and catch tips.</li>
      <li><strong>Weather Integration:</strong> Automatically logs weather data for each fishing trip, including temperature, wind speed, and humidity.</li>
      <li><strong>Interactive Map:</strong> Allows users to pin fishing locations and view historical data of trips taken in specific locations.</li>
      <li><strong>Catch Statistics:</strong> Visualize fishing patterns with charts showing total catch by species, location, and time.</li>
      <li><strong>GPS Tracking:</strong> Use GPS to track the user's fishing trip routes and mark the exact spots where catches occurred.</li>
      <li><strong>Personalized Fishing Tips:</strong> AI-based recommendations on where and when to fish based on previous logs and weather data.</li>
      <li><strong>Photo Logging:</strong> Upload and attach photos of your catches directly to the log entry for future reference.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Sharing:</strong> Share your best catches with friends through social media directly from the app.</li>
    </ul>
